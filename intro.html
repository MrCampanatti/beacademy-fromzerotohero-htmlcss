    <h2>Subtítulo</h2>
    <p>Sanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew.Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef "Red Leg" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. Is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his "love-cook" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them.</p>
